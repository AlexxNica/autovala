# AUTOVALA #

## WHAT IS IT? ##

Autovala is a program and a library designed to help in the creation of
projects with Vala and CMake.

The idea is quite simple: CMake is very powerful, but writting the CMakeLists
files is boring and repetitive. Why not let the computer create them, by
guessing what to do with each file? And if, at the end, there are mistakes,
let the user fix them in an easy way, and generate the final CMakeLists files.

This is what Autovala does. This process is done in three steps:

  * First, Autovala checks all the folders and files, and writes a project
    file with the type of each file
  * It also peeks the source files to determine which Vala packages they need,
    and generate automagically that list
  * After that (and after allowing the user to check, if (s)he wishes, the
    project file), it uses that project file to generate the needed CMakeLists
    files

* version 0.12.0 (2013-04-09)
    * When checking VAPI files, now will give priority to the version number inside it (gir_version), and only when there is no such number will use the one in the filename

    * Translation to spanish
    * Fixed messages

    * New format for the version string inside source code, that allows to set it in libraries without clash
* version 0.10.0 (2013-04-07)
    * Allows to link an executable with a library from the same project
