While Autovala is fully usable, there are still a lot of things that I want to add to it, and I will need help.

 * Support localization of desktop files

 * Allow to mix .vala and .c files

 * Allow that a binary being compiled be able to use a library compiled in the same project

     This is a must if I want to distribute Autovala both as a library, and as a command line program that uses that library.

 * Integrate it as a plugin for Gedit or, even better, integrate it with [Valencia](http://redmine.yorba.org/projects/valencia/wiki)
