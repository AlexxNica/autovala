While Autovala is fully usable, there are still a lot of things that I want to add to it, and I will need help.

 * Allow that a binary being compiled be able to use a library compiled in the
   same project

   This is a must if I want to distribute Autovala both as a library, and as
   a command line program that uses that library.

 * Generate automatically the .pc file for a library (for pkg-config)

   I need help with the format of the .pc files

 * Integrate it as a plugin for Gedit
