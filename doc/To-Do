<p>While Autovala is fully usable, there are still a lot of things that I want to add to it, and I will need help.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Support localization of desktop files</p></li>
<li><p>Allow that a binary being compiled be able to use a library compiled in the same project</p>
<p>This is a must if I want to distribute Autovala both as a library, and as a command line program that uses that library.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate automatically the .pc file for a library (for pkg-config) (I need help with the format of the .pc files)</p></li>
<li><p>Integrate it as a plugin for Gedit</p></li>
</ul>
