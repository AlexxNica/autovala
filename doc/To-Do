<p>While Autovala is fully usable, there are still a lot of things that I want to add to it, and I will need help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow that a binary being compiled be able to use a library compiled in the<br /> same project</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a must if I want to distribute Autovala both as a library, and as<br /> a command line program that uses that library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate automatically the .pc file for a library (for pkg-config)</li>
</ul>
<p>I need help with the format of the .pc files</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate it as a plugin for Gedit</li>
</ul>
