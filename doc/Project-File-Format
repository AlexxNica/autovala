<h1>Project File Format</h1>

<p>The project file has a very simple format. Usually you don't need to
manually edit it, but when the guesses of autovala are incorrect, you can do
it, and your changes will be remembered each time you refresh the file.</p>

<p>The file is based on commands in the format:</p>

<pre><code>    command: data
</code></pre>

<p>one in each line. Every line that starts with # is ignored (is a comment),
but also will be removed when the file is recreated.</p>

<p>The first line in a project file is, always, ### AutoVala Project ###. This
string identifies it as an Autovala project file.</p>

<p>The next line has the command "autovala_version". This command specifies which
version of the syntax uses this file, to avoid an old version of Autovala
to open a newer, with commands that it wouldn't understand.</p>

<p>The next line has the command "project_name". This command sets the name
assigned to this project.</p>

<p>Then, the next line contains "vala_version", which specifies the minimum Vala
version needed to compile this project. By default, it is filled with the
version number of the vala version installed when the project was created.</p>

<p>After that, it comes several commands, some of them repeated several times,
to specify what to do with each file in your project. These commands are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>po: specifies the folder where to store the translations. By default it's "po".
The program identifier for Gettext is the project name.</p></li>
<li><p>data: specifies a folder with local data that must be installed in
  share/project_name. By default it's "data/local".</p></li>
<li><p>doc: specifies a folder with the documentation that must be installed in
  share/doc/project_name. By default it's "doc".</p></li>
<li><p>vala_binary:  contains a path and a name, and specifies that, in the path, there
          are several source files that must be compiled to create that
          binary. Example:</p>

<pre><code>vala_binary: src/test_file
</code></pre>

<p>says that the src
folder contains the source files to create the binary test_file
After this command will come several subcommands that specifies
details about this binary. Those are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>version: contains the version of this binary file. It is more useful when
     creating libraries. If it is not set manually in the project file,
     Autovala will check the source files for a global variable with
     the format:</p>

<pre><code>       const string project_version="X.Y.Z";
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>and will use that number as version. If it is unable to find it
in none of the source files, then it will use 1.0.0 by default.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>namespace: contains the namespace used in all the source files. It is more
       useful when creating libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>compile_options: contains the options to pass to the Vala compiler. Example:</p>

<pre><code>         compile_options: -X -O2
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>vala_package: specify a package that must be added with --pkg=... to the
          vala compiler. These are automatically found by Autovala
          by reading the sources and processing the "Using" directives</p></li>
<li><p>vala<em>check</em>package: is like vala<em>package, but these packages must, also,
                be checked during cmake to ensure that they are
                installed in the system. Autovala founds these
                automatically by reading the sources, as with
                vala</em>package, and checking if the corresponding .pc
                file exists</p></li>
<li><p>vala_source: this command specifies one source file that belongs to this
         binary</p>

<pre><code>   The last three subcommand can be repeated as many times as
   needed to specify all the sources and packages needed.
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>vala<em>library: the same than vala</em>binary, but creates a dynamic linking library.
          It uses the same subcommands.</p></li>
<li><p>binary: specifies that the file is a precompiled binary (or a shell script) that
    must be copied as-is to bin/</p></li>
<li><p>icon: followed by the category and the icon path/name. Autovala will determine
  the icon size and use it to copy it to the right place (only if it's a
  .png file; it it's a .svg will copy to "scalable"). Also, by default, the
  category will be "apps", unless it is a .svg with "-symbolic"; in that
  case will be put in the "status" category. Example:</p>

<pre><code>      icon: apps finger.svg
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>pixmap: followed by a picture filename. Will be copied to share/pixmaps</p></li>
<li><p>glade: the file specified is a glade UI file, that will be installed in
   share/project_name/ These files, and the .vala source files, will
   be used with gettext to get the translatable strings.</p></li>
<li><p>dbus<em>service: the file specified is a D-Bus service. The file must be written
          as a classic D-Bus service file, but prefixing the binary
          filename with @DBUS</em>PREFIX@. Example from Cronopete:</p>

<pre><code>      [D-BUS Service]
      Name=com.rastersoft.cronopete
      Exec=@DBUS_PREFIX@/bin/cronopete
</code></pre>

<p>This allows to use cmake to install everything in a temporary
folder, and ensure that the Exec entry points to the right place.
This is important when using these CMakeLists files for creating
a .deb or .rpm package.</p></li>
<li><p>desktop: the file specified is a .desktop file that must be copied to
     share/applications to ensure that it is shown in the applications menu</p></li>
<li><p>eos_plug: the file is an ElementaryOS plug for the configuration system</p></li>
<li><p>scheme: the file is a GSettings file that contains configuration settings.
    It is automagically compiled if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>autostart: the file is a .desktop one, but must be installed in
       /etc/xdg/autostart because the program specified there must be
       launched automatically when starting the desktop session. Don't
       forget to add X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true inside</p></li>
<li><p>include: allows to include the specified file in the CMakeLists of its path
     This allows to manually add CMake statements. Example:</p>

<pre><code>         include: src/mycmake.txt
</code></pre>

<p>will append the contents of the file mycmake.txt, located in the src/
folder, to the end of the CMakeLists.txt file also located in the
src/ folder</p></li>
<li><p>ignore: the path that follows will be ignored when Autovala guesses each
    file. Examples:</p>

<pre><code>ignore: src/PROG/test.vala will ignore the file test.vala when automatically creating the PROG binary


ignore: src/OTHER will ignore the folder OTHER when creating binaries
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
