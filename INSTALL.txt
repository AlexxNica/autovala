HOW TO INSTALL

You need CMake, Vala 0.16 or later, libgee and gtk+.
The repository includes a version of CMake for Vala
that includes some changes (not mine) to support
Valadoc. These changes still aren't available at the
oficial repository. You can get the oficial files with

    bzr checkout lp:~elementary-apps/+junk/cmake-modules

To compile and install it, just open a terminal, go
to the directory where you downloaded the git repository
and type:

    mkdir install
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
